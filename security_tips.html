    <h2>Follow These Safety Tips on Campus</h2>
    <ul class="safety-tips">
        <li>Never walk alone, especially at night. Plan to walk in groups, use the shuttle service, or request security to escort you.</li>
        <li>Avoid isolated areas, especially when you exercise early in the morning or late in the afternoon.</li>
        <li>Keep your phone and valuables out of sight.</li>
        <li>Carry a whistle and pepper spray at all times to be able to draw attention if needed. Criminals hate attention!</li>
        <li>Choose the safest route, even if it is not the shortest. Stick to Victoria Street and Bosman Street, where security officers are stationed in mobile security kiosks at night.</li>
        <li>Be conscious of your immediate environment as criminals prefer to target those who are not aware of their direct surroundings.</li>
        <li>Keep a safe distance if a motorist asks for directions.</li>
        <li>If you suspect that someone might be following you, change direction.</li>
        <li>Be a caring Matie: accompany a friend.</li>
        <li>Property on a car seat is tempting to a thief. Lock it in the boot.</li>
        <li>Invest in a U-lock to safeguard your bicycle and make use of bicycle sheds on campus.</li>
    </ul>
